            <p class="column">My name is Monika and I am Polish. I graduated in lingustic studies (German philology). In 2015 I decided to start a new adventure abroad and since then I live and work in Geneva, Switzerland. My professional path was always fulfilled with multilingual customer service positions. I am very proud to share that this website was created as a final project of the course "50 things you need to know about the Internet" at EPFL Extension school which I completed within "My digital future" fellowship.</p>
